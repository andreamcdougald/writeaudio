            Did you know that writing can help you ease feelings anxious and
            reduce stress? Even with knowing all the benefits, itâ€™s still hard
            to get into it and do it regularly. This is why we built Writemind.

          <p className="mx-auto mt-5 max-w-xl text-xl text-gray-500">
            Our company vision is to guide our users to feel calmer, have better
            focus, and eventually build a habit of writing.
